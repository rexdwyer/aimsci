	<p><strong>TITLE AND ABBREVIATION</strong></p>
<p>Title: Reactive Oxygen Species<br />Uniform Title: Reactive Oxygen Species (Apex, N.C.)&nbsp;<br />NLM Title Abbreviation: React Oxyg Species (Apex)<br />ISO Abbreviation: React Oxyg Species (Apex)<br />ISSN: 2380-2367<br />LCCN: 2015202244<br />NLM ID: <a href="http://locatorplus.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search_Arg=101688617&amp;Search_Code=0359&amp;CNT=20&amp;SID=1">101688617</a> [Serial]</p>
<p><strong>FOCUS AND SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) is a peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the rapid dissemination of new knowledge on reactive oxygen and related species/entities (including antioxidants) in chemistry, biology, and medicine. ROS publishes four types of contributions: (i) review articles by experts in the related fields; (ii) highlights of the most recent cutting edge research findings published in highly influential journals; (iii) research method protocols; and (iv) original research contributions.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION POLICIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Review Articles</strong></p>
<p>ROS publishes review articles from leading experts in the field. The topics may range from basic science of reactive oxygen and related species/entities (including antioxidants) to their involvement in human physiology and clinical medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Research Highlights</strong></p>
<p>ROS publishes research highlights of the most recent cutting edge findings on reactive oxygen and related species/entities (including antioxidants) published in <a href="https://tools.niehs.nih.gov/srp/publications/highimpactjournals.cfm">highly influential journals</a>, such as New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Lancet, Nature, Science, and Cell, among others.</p>
<p><strong>ROS Protocols</strong></p>
<p>ROS publishes protocols of established research methods for the detection and/or measurement of reactive oxygen and related species/entities (including antioxidants) as well as their biological effects with an emphasis on method protocols that can be easily followed.</p>
<p><strong>Original Research Articles</strong></p>
<p>ROS publishes original research articles on reactive oxygen and related species/entities (including antioxidants) in chemistry, biology, and medicine.</p>
<p><strong>PEER REVIEW PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>As an AIMSCI-sponsored Journal with no manuscript processing and publication fees, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) strives to contribute to the advancement of science by publishing cutting edge knowledge on reactive oxygen and related species/entities (including antioxidants) in chemistry, biology, and medicine. The Journal publishes articles of the highest scientific quality and integrity, and emphasizes the quality rather than the quantity of the publications. In this regard, all manuscripts submitted to ROS will undergo a two-phase review process. The manuscript will be first evaluated by the Journal’s Editorial Review Committee consisting of three internationally well-recognized experts in the field for its scientific merit and broad impact. This editorial review typically takes less than 3 working days. Manuscripts judged to be of significant scientific merit and broad impact will then undergo the second phase peer review by at least two outside experts in the field. Manuscripts judged to be of limited scientific merit and little broad impact by the Editorial Review Committee will be declined without further undergoing the second phase peer review.</p>
<p>The eventual acceptance of a manuscript for publication in ROS will be primarily based on assessing the peer reviewers’ comments in four areas including (1) the originality, (2) the quality, (3) the potential impact, and (4) the readability of the work in conjunction with the recommendations by the Journal’s Editorial Review Committee.</p>
<p>The typical turn-around time for peer review is about 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHING FREQUENCY</strong></p>
<p>Reactive Oxygen Species is a bimonthly journal that publishes 6 issues in 2 volumes per year.</p>
<p><strong>ARCHIVING</strong></p>
<p>This journal utilizes the LOCKSS system to create a distributed archiving system among participating libraries and permits those libraries to create permanent archives of the journal for purposes of preservation and restoration. <a href="http://www.lockss.org/">More...</a></p>
<p><strong>NO PUBLICATION FEES &amp; ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p>There are no fees associated with processing and publishing articles in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Selection of a manuscript for publication in ROS is solely based on the scientific merit and impact of the work as judged primarily by assessing the peer reviewers' comments in combination with the recommendations by the Journal's Editorial Review Committee.</p>
<p>The ROS Editorial Office strongly discourages the withdrawal of an accepted manuscript by the author(s) at the late stage of copyediting/layout-editing unless for a reason related to research ethics. A fee may need to be paid by the author(s) to defray the costs incurred for copy-editing/layout-editing of the accepted manuscript if the author(s) decides to withdraw the accepted manuscript at this late stage of publication in ROS.</p>
<p>The ROS Editorial Office reserves the right to decline an accepted manuscript if a critical issue (including, but not limited to, publishing ethics violation, inappropriate data presentation and interpretation, and poor quality of images or illustrations) is uncovered at any step of the editorial processing of the accepted manuscript. Likewise, an accepted manuscript may also be subjected to substantial changes at the stage of copy-/layout-editing in the ROS Layout Office to improve the quality and accuracy of the work and to ensure compliance with the ROS Editorial Policy; such substantial changes, however, must be approved by both the ROS Editorial Review Committee and the Editor-in-Chief, and also agreed to by the corresponding author of the accepted manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>SERVING ON THE BOARD OF ROS</strong></p>
<p>The Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Editorial Office greatly appreciates the support and contributions from the members of the advisory and editorial board. Serving on the board of ROS does not bear any obligations though the board member is encouraged to submit and/or recommend manuscripts of sufficient quality to the Journal. Appointment for serving on the board of ROS is typically on a 3-year term. The board member may decide to discontinue the appointment at any time by sending an email notice to the ROS Editorial Office (ros.editorial@aimsci.com) without providing any reasons. Likewise, the Journal reserves the right to terminate the board member status at any time during the 3-year appointment term without any stated reasons.</p>
<p><strong>ETHICS IN PUBLISHING</strong></p>
<p>As stated elsewhere in the Journal, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) strives to publish articles of the highest scientific quality and integrity. The Journal strictly adheres to the fundamental principles of ethics in publishing.

<p><strong>RESEARCH INTEGRITY</strong></p>
<p>Maintaining a high standard of research integrity is essential to the success of the research (especially biomedical research) enterprise and benefits the public health and society in general. Various governmental agencies and private organizations have published policies and guidelines on research integrity. Some of the fundamental principles of research integrity include: intellectual honesty in proposing, performing, and reporting research; accuracy in representing contributions to research proposals and reports; fairness in peer review; collegiality in scientific interactions, including communications and sharing of resources; transparency in conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest; protection of human subjects in the conduct of research; humane care of animals in the conduct of research; and adherence to the mutual responsibilities between investigators and their research teams. With regard to studies involving human subjects, appropriate consents and permissions must be obtained in compliance with pertaining policies and regulations at the various levels, including, but not limited to, the federal and state levels. Likewise, appropriate policies and regulations must be followed with regard to humane care of animals in the conduct of research. It is the responsibility of the author(s) to ensure the compliance with the above laws, regulations, and guidelines on research integrity.</p>
