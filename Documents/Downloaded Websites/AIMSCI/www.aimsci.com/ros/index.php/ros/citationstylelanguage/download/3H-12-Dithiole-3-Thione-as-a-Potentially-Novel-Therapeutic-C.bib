This brief Research Highlights paper considers 3&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), a member of the 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones—compounds which may naturally occur in cruciferous vegetables. Among 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones, D3T is the most potent member with regard to the capacity of inducing tissue defenses against oxidative and inflammatory stress. Oxidative and inflammatory stress is a major pathophysiological process involved in numerous human disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, and sepsis, to name just a few. This article surveys recent major research findings on D3T as an inducer of tissue antioxidative and anti-inflammatory defenses and as a potential therapeutic modality for sepsis intervention.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={22}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Li, Y.
