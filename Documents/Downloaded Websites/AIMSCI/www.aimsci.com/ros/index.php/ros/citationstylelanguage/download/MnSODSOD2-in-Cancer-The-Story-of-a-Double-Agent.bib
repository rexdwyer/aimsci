This first barrier is important to prevent early stages of cancer development. However, once the tumor is established, upregulation of MnSOD without a concomitant increase of scavengers of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) plays a much complex role. It contributes to proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion, affecting glycolytic metabolism and preventing the mitochondria from inducing apoptosis favoring therapy resistance. The increase of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mediated by MnSODis able to induce phenotypical changes in several tumor types, such as epithelia-mesenchymal transition increasing the motility of tumor cells, neuroendocrine differentiation and senescent secretory phenotypes which feed tumor progression by producing cytokines and growth factors.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={14}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Mayo, Juan C. and Sainz, Rosa M. and Quiros-Gonzalez, Isabel}, year={2018}, month={Mar.}, pages={86â€“106} }
