With bicarbonate-enhanced luminol-dependent chemiluminometry, we further showed a nearly complete blockage of peroxynitrite-derived chemiluminescence by acetaminophen at 25‒100 µM with minimal effects on SIN-1-mediated oxygen consumption, suggesting acetaminophen as a potent scavenger of peroxynitrite. Electron spin resonance spectrometry in combination with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&#38;gt;-oxide (DMPO)-spin-trapping supported the ability of acetaminophen at high concentrations to diminish the production of a free radical species (likely hydroxyl radical) from SIN-1. Fenton chemistry-based DMPO-spin trapping further demonstrated the hydroxyl radical-scavenging capacity of acetaminophen. Collectively, the results of this study for the first time revealed the potential of acetaminophen to protect against peroxyitrite toxicity, which may have important implications in neuroprotection associated with the use of this popular analgesic and antipyretic drug.}, number={8}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Dou, Xueqing and Li, Jason Z. and Danelisen, Igor and Trush, Michael A. and Misra, Hara P. and Zhu, Hong and Jia, Zhenquan and Li, Y.
