To identify the consequences of OPA1 loss of function on intracellular redox homeostasis, we used the DOA mouse model B6; C3-OPA1329-355del (&lt;em&gt;OPA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/‒&lt;/sup&gt;). Brain cortices from 15-month-old &lt;em&gt;OPA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/‒&lt;/sup&gt; mice and littermates &lt;em&gt;OPA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; were analyzed for their aconitase activity and antioxidant defenses. We found a decreased aconitase activity testifying an increase in ROS levels together with constant levels of antioxidant enzymes quantities such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), SOD2, or catalase in 15-month old &lt;em&gt;OPA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/‒&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Likewise, catalase activity is stable in the two genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, the pro-oxidative state that we identified in the brain tissues of 15-month-old DOA mice was previously observed in the 4- and 10-month-old DOA mice model. Thus, brain cortices from aged &lt;em&gt;Opa1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/‒&lt;/sup&gt;mice are in a pro-oxidative state.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={18}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Daloyau, Marlene and Millet, Aurelie M.C. and Miquel, Marie-Christine and Mils, Valerie and Wissinger, Bernd and Belenguer, Pascale and Davezac, Noelie}, year={2018}, month={Nov.}, pages={396–405} }
