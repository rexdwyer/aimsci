In line with this notion, the aim of this Research Highlights article was to summarize the new role of PBM in the oxidative stress resulting from anaerobic exercise. Thus, this Research Highlights article briefly summarizes the findings reported in a recent article published in &lt;em&gt;Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity&lt;/em&gt; (February 18, 2018; doi: 10.1155/2018/5763256) by de Oliveira et al., which reported that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) can protect skeletal muscles from oxidative stress induced by acute resistance exercise (RE). In fact, rats that underwent laser irradiation in the gastrocnemius muscle prior to RE bout showed a similar lipoperoxidation level to that of non-exercised rats. Animals in the LLLT group were also protected from attack by reactive oxygen species on their amino acids, as was revealed by the changes in the oxidized proteincontent. This study by de Oliveira et al. provides novel insights into the PBM process, which acts as a suppressor of the excessive oxidative stress evoked by RE.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={21}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Sunemi, Simone M. and Silva, Flávio André and Antonio, Ednei Luiz and Tucci, Paulo José Ferreira and Serra, Andrey Jorge}, year={2019}, month={May}, pages={148–153} }
