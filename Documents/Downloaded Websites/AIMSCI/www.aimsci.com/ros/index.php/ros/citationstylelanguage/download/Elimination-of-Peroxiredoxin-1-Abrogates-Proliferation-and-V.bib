In order to successfully metastasize to these regional and distant sites, tumor cells must be able to overcome extracellular matrix (ECM)-detachment-induced effects, including combatting increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we investigate peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and find that PRDX1 plays an important role in proliferation in ECM-attached and ECM-detached SKOV3 cells, an epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell line. Furthermore, we find that PRDX1 deficiency in SKOV3 cells promotes a substantial decrease in cell viability in ECM detachment contributing to abrogated cell growth in anchorage independence. Thus, our study finds that PRDX1 deficiency uniquely compromises cell viability in ECM-detached cells, suggesting that PRDX1 could be a potential therapeutic target for late-stage epithelial ovarian carcinoma.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={23}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Axe, Alyssa and Gilligan, Siobhan M. and Green, Mary and Gonzalez, Yadira and Milos, Adrian and Davison-Versagli, Calli A.}, year={2019}, month={Sep.}, pages={276â€“286} }
