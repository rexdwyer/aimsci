@article{Hopkins_2017, title={Peroxiredoxins in Redox Relay}, volume={3}, url={https://aimsci.com/ros/index.php/ros/article/view/93}, abstractNote={Peroxyredoxin  (Prx) is one of the three major defenses against hydrogen peroxide toxicity, with the other two being catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Prx represents a family of enzymes that currently include 6 members, namely, Prx 1-6. In addition to their classical function in hydrogen peroxide detoxification, some Prx isozyme may also function as signaling molecules. This ROS Research Highlights article summarizes some recent key research findings on Prx-mediated redox signaling, pinpointing certain Prx isozymes as signaling antioxidants.}, number={9}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Hopkins, Robert Z.}, year={2017}, month={May}, pages={184‒188} }
