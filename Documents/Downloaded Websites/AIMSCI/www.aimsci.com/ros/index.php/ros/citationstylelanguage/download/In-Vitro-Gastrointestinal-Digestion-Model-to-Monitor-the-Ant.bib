The potential bioavailability of elderberry antioxidants after GI digestion was further determined by employing a membrane model using dialysis tubing. Our results showed that simulated GI digestion significantly decreased 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the elderberry antioxidant extract, but had no effect on its total phenolic content (TPC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value. After GI digestion, more than 75% of phenolic content in the elderberry extract was absorbable according to our simulated dialysis experiment. The impact of GI digestion on individual antioxidants in the elderberry extract was determined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Ten individual antioxidants were identified and quantified by HPLC with chlorogenic acid, rutin, catechin, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-coumaric acid, and quercetin as the major phenolic compounds in the elderberry extract. GI digestion increased the concentrations of chlorogenic acid and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&#38;gt;-coumaric acid but decreased epicatechin and quercetin 3-glucoside content in the elderberry extract.}, number={6}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Zhou, Ninghui and Zhu, Wenjun and Yang, Fei and Zhou, Kequan}, year={2016}, month={Nov.}, pages={421â€’431} }
