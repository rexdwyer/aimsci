@article{Hu_Ren_2016, title={Epigenetics in Smoking-Associated Cardiovascular Diseases}, volume={2}, url={https://aimsci.com/ros/index.php/ros/article/view/60}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Inhaled tobacco products cause ever rising cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and impose a global healthcare crisis. Earlier studies from our laboratory and others have indicated that inhaled toxicants of cigarette smoke are independent risk factors for a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism behind cigarette smoking-induced cardiovascular sequelae remains somewhat poorly understood. Here, we updated the potential modulations of epigenetics in cigarette smoke-induced challenge to gene expression, which may sequentially affect cardiac structure and function. With the recent advances in new techniques such as high-throughput sequencing and genome-wide chromatin assays, epigenetic aspects of health and disease have exploded in many epigenome-wide approaches. These techniques have the potential to provide diverse opportunities for clinical phenotype screening and exploring novel therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={6}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Hu, Nan and Ren, Jun}, year={2016}, month={Nov.}, pages={396â€’403} }
