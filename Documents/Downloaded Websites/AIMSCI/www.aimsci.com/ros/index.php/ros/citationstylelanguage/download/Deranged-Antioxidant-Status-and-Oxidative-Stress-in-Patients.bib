It is the second most common cancer in women of all ages in Ethiopia. Radiotherapy is one of the treatment strategies, but its effect on production of oxygen free radicals that leads to oxidative stress requires proper attention and investigation. In this study oxidative stress in 43 patients with cervical carcinoma before and in the course of radiotherapy was assessed versus 20 normal subjects. Sera were collected at 4 time points from patients, i.e., before radiotherapy, and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of radiotherapy, but only once from normal controls. Reduced total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was observed in patients than normal subjects before and after radiotherapy. Significantly elevated total peroxide concentration (TPC) was seen in the course of radiotherapy. TPC values at the end of radiotherapy were significantly higher compared to before and after radiotherapy. Oxidative stress index in patients was significantly elevated compared to controls during and at the end of therapy. Levels of lipid peroxides in patients were markedly elevated compared to controls. Our findings showed that cervical cancer induces increased production of oxygen free radicals and radiotherapy has a synergetic effect on the production of oxygen free radicals leading to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={13}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Genet, Solomon and Gamin, Mengistu and El Metwally, Tarek H.}, year={2018}, month={Jan.}, pages={68â€“77} }
