Throughout metastasis, ovarian epithelial cancer cells must overcome many feats, including surviving in extracellular matrix (ECM) detachment. ECM-detached cancer cells must evade a number of insults, including increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent evidence suggests ECM-detached cancer cells rely on antioxidant enzymes to combat these increasing levels of ROS to promote survival; however, the specific antioxidant enzymes involved in this process have yet to be fully elucidated. Sestrin 2 (SESN2) is a multi-functional protein that has been found to be instrumental in many different signaling pathways; notably, it has been recognized to play a critical role in eliminating ROS. Here, we show that SESN2 plays a unique role in maintaining the viability of ECM-detached metastatic ovarian epithelial cancer cells, and elimination of this critical protein results in compromised viability. Thus, these data identify SESN2 as a potentially interesting therapeutic target for treating this deadly metastatic disease.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={24}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Gonzalez, Yadira and Tulisiak, Leann and Philbin, Mary and Voss, Hannah and Schramm, Ethan and Ruelas, Irma and Davison-Versagli, Calli A.}, year={2019}, month={Nov.}, pages={332â€“340} }
