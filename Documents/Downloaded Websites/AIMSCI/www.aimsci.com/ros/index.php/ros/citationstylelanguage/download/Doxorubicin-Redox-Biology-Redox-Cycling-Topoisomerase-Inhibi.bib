The clinical use of doxorubicin is, however, associated with dosage-dependent cardiotoxicity and development of heart failure, which diminish the therapeutic index of this widely used anticancer drug. This article first surveys key research findings on doxorubicin redox biology that may impact its cardiotoxicity as well as anticancer activity. It then discusses emerging concepts, especially the topoisomerase IIb‒p53‒mitochondrion axis that may lead to the development of mechanistically based novel strategies to protect against cardiotoxicity and enhance the effectiveness of doxorubicin therapy.}, number={3}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Zhu, Hong and Sarkar, Soumyadeep and Scott, Laura and Danelisen, Igor and Trush, Michael A. and Jia, Zhenquan and Li, Y.
