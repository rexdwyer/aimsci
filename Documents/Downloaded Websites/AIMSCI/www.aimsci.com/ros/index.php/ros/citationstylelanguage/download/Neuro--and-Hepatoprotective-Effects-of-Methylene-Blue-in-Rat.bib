Rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS (300 µg/kg) alone or along with MethyB (5 and 10 mg/kg) and euthanized 4 h later. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity, cholinesterase activity, and glucose were measured in the serum. The brain and liver histopathology, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and caspase-3 immunostaining in the brain were performed. Results indicated that LPS treatment caused significantly raised MDA and nitric oxide concentrations by 52.8% and 47.5%, respectively. Cholinesterase activity was not significantly changed, but PON1 activity fell by 48.1%. Serum glucose increased by 48.7%. When administered to LPS-injected rats, MethyB resulted in significant decreases in serum MDA and nitric oxide concentrations, respectively. PON-1 activity increased by 37.8-89.3%, cholinesterase activity decreased by 33.4-41.2%, and serum glucose decreased by 39.6% uponMethyB treatment. Neurodegeneration, increased capsase-3 staining, decreased GFAP immunostaining in the brain and vacuolar degeneration and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the liver of LPS-treated rats were almost prevented by MethyB. These data suggest that MethyB exerts an antioxidant action and ameliorates brain and liver tissue damage during endotoxemia.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={17}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Abdel-Salam, Omar M.E. and Sleem, Amany A. and Youness, Eman R. and Mohammed, Nadia A. and Shaffie, Nermeen and Yassen, Noha N.}, year={2018}, month={Sep.}, pages={325–337} }
