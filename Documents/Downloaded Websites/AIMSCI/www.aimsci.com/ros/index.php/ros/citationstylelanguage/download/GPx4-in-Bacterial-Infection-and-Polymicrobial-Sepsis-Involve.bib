In this Research Highlights article, we discuss the recent research findings regarding a protective role for glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx4) in bacterial infection and polymicrobial sepsis via modulating ferroptosis and pyroptosis, two novel modes of regulated cell death. It is suggested that GPx4, being a requisite gateway to both ferroptosis and pyroptosis, may serve as a critical molecular target for developing effective drugs for controlling infection and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={21}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Zhu, Hong and Santo, Arben and Jia, Zhenquan and Li, Y.
