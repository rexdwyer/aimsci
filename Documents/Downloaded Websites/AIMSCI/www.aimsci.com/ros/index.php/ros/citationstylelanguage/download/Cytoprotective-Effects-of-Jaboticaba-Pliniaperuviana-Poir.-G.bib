Govaerts) Fruit Peel Extracts against H2O2-Induced Oxidative Stress}, volume={4}, url={https://aimsci.com/ros/index.php/ros/article/view/105}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress is a result of disturbance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants defenses. Plant secondary metabolites can be used as exogenous antioxidants to prevent human oxidative stress-related diseases. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of jaboticaba fruit peel hydroalcoholic extracts against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative stress in a murine fibroblast (L929 cell line) model. Ultra-high pressure hydroalcoholic extracts (50% ethanol, UP) were obtained over 4 h, with 1 h interval between collections. UP 3 h and UP 4 h extracts presented the highest and the lowest phenolic and flavonoid contents, respectively. Antioxidant capacity showed that 1 mg/ml extracts inhibited 90% of DPPH radical activity and UP 1 h extract had significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) higher scavenging activity than other extracts at this concentration. After 24 h of exposure to UP 4 h extracts, cell viability was significantly increased when compared to control, UP 1 h, and UP 2 h extracts. When cells were previously treated with UP hydroalcoholic extracts followed by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;exposure, all extracts at 0.05 and 0.1 mg/ml exhibited significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) cytoprotective effects in relation to control. Results demonstrated that jaboticaba fruit peel extracts are antioxidants and exert cytoprotective effects under H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative stress.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={11}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Pitz, Heloisa da Silva and Pereira, Aline and Voytena, Ana Paula Lorenzen and Trevisan, Adriana Carla Dias and Affonso, Regina Celis Lopes and Ribeiro-do-Valle, Rosa Maria and Maraschin, Marcelo}, year={2017}, month={Sep.}, pages={362â€’371} }
