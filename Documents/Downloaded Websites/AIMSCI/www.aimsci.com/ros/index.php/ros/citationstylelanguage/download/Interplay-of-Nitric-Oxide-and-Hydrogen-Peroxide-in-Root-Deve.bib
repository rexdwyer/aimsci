It is influenced by endogenous levels of signaling molecules like NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2, &lt;/sub&gt;by controlling the polarity of cell, the pattern of cell division and cell cycle dynamics. The NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also regulate the cell functions either by up-regulating or down-regulating several genes which govern different physiological functions. These two signaling molecules (NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) also interact with various plant hormones and guide the peculiar function which is implicated in the process of root development. Recent past studies have demonstrated the crosstalk of NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in root development under stressed as well as non-stressed conditions. In this review, implication of NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crosstalk and its relation with other signaling molecules and phytohormones in root development is discussed.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={25}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Suhel, Mohammad and Husain, Tajammul and Singh, Samiksha and Pandey, Aparna and Singh, Sani Kumar and Fatima, Abreeq and Singh, Vijay Pratap and Prasad, Sheo Mohan}, year={2020}, month={Jan.}, pages={1â€“12} }
