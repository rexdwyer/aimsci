@article{Zhu_Jia_Trush_Li_2016, title={Nrf2 Deficiency Promotes Melanoma Growth and Lung Metastasis}, volume={2}, url={https://aimsci.com/ros/index.php/ros/article/view/53}, abstractNote={The role of Nrf2, a key regulator of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes, in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Here we showed that Nrf2 deficiency led to increased local tumor growth in mice following subcutaneous injection of B16-F10 melanoma cells, as indicated by increased proportion of animals with locally palpable tumor mass and time-dependent increases in tumor volume at the injection site. In vivo bioluminescence imaging also revealed increased growth of melanoma in Nrf2-null mice as compared with wild-type mice. By using a highly sensitive bioluminometric assay, we further found that Nrf2 deficiency resulted in a remarkable increase in lung metastasis of B16-F10 melanoma cells as compared with wild-type mice. Taken together, the results of this short communication for the first time demonstrated that Nrf2 deficiency promoted melanoma growth and lung metastasis following subcutaneous inoculation of B16-F10 cells in mice.}, number={4}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Zhu, Hong and Jia, Zhenquan and Trush, Michael A. and Li, Y.
