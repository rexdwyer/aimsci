The environmental changes, stress and other factors could induce spontaneous exit from metaphase-II arrest (EM-II), a first sign of abortive spontaneous egg activation (SEA) that deteriorates egg quality in few mammalian species including rat. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) play a major role in oocyte meiosis but their role in abortive SEA remains ill understood. We examined ROS, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and maturation promoting factor (MPF) levels. We observed that postovulatory aging induced EM-II in vivo as evident by initiation of extrusion of second polar body (PB-II) but never completed. The ROS and cytosolic free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;levels were increased that resulted in MPF destabilization and thereby EM-II. In summary, our study suggests that inability of rat eggs to maintain M-II arrest may be due to premature onset of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;- and/or ROS-mediated MPF destabilization that deteriorates egg quality. The poor-quality egg directly impacts reproductive outcome in several mammalian species.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={15}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Chaube, Shail K. and Premkumar, Karuppanan V. and Prasad, Shilpa and Tiwari, Meenakshi and Gupta, Anumegha and Sharma, Alka and Sahu, Kankshi and Yadav, Pramod K.}, year={2018}, month={May}, pages={167â€“175} }
