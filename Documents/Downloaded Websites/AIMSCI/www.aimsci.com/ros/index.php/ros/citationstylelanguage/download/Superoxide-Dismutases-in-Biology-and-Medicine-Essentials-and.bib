SODs are among the most extensively studied antioxidant enzymes in mammalian systems. This article provides an overview on the basic biochemistry and molecular regulation of SODs and summarizes recent cutting-edge research findings on their biological functions as well as implications in health and disease.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={25}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Little, Ben D. and Hopkins, Robert Z.}, year={2020}, month={Jan.}, pages={13â€“21} }
