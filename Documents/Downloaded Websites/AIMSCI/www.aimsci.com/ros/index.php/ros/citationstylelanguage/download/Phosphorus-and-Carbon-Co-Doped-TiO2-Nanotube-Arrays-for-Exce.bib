To evaluate the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under visible light response, the synthesized samples that was annealed at 400°C were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) techniques. Methylene blue (MB) was used as a target pollutant and a scavenger test was conducted to evaluate the release of ROS from TNA. TNA with different morphology attained by varying the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and ethylene glycol (EG) during anodization. TNA with 3.1µm length and 103 nm average diameter were obtained using 90 EG:10 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixture at 30 V for 1 h which then increased to 6.8 µm and 196.8 nm, respectively by adding 1% of water. The PL result revealed that the number of crystal defects was reduced after the addition of water, which thus improved the separation rate of photo-generated charges. The band gap energy of TNA was reduced from 3.1 to 2.4 eV. It is indicated that the TNA with C and P doping showed improved visible light response. The scavenger test revealed that superoxide and hydroxyl radical are the dominant ROS that contributed to the excellent photo-degradation of MB.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={17}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Sreekantan, Srimala and Saharudin, Khairul Arifah and Basiron, Norfatehah and S.
