However, many of the details behind this phenomenon have yet to be unveiled. Here, we examined the role of the antioxidant enzyme, catalase, in the survival and proliferation of anchorage-independent SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Catalase deficiency severely compromises cell viability and anchorage-independent growth in ECM-detached SKOV3 cells. Notably, cellviability and proliferation were unaffected in ECM-attached catalase-deficient SKOV3 cells. In aggregate, we discovered that catalase plays a prominent role in protection from ECM-detachment-induced cell death in SKOV3 cells. Furthermore, these findings imply that catalase may be an effective therapeutic target for epithelial ovarian cancer cells that survive the ECM-bereft metastatic cascade.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={20}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Libbing, Cassandra L. and Jungles, Kassidy M. and Rabaut, Ellen and Davison-Versagli, Calli A.}, year={2019}, month={Mar.}, pages={121â€“128} }
