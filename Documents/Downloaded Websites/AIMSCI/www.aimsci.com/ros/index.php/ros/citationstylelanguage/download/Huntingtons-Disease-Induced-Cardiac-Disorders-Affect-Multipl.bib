@article{Melkani_2016, title={Huntington’s Disease-Induced Cardiac Disorders Affect Multiple Cellular Pathways}, volume={2}, url={https://aimsci.com/ros/index.php/ros/article/view/55}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare, inherited, progressive, and fatal neurological disorder resulting from expanded polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein. While HD is predominately characterized as a disease of the central nervous system, mortality surveys and epidemiological studies reveal heart disease as one of the leading causes of death in HD patients. Emerging evidence supports a link between HD and cardiovascular disease, such as cardiac amyloidosis (accumulation of aggregates in the heart). Experimental animal and clinical studies have attempted to explain the mechanisms of HD-induced cardiac pathology in the association of protein misfolding, autophagic defects, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. HD is increasingly understood as a complex disease with peripheral components of cardiac and skeletal muscle pathophysiology&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;While the discovery of these linkages and apparent pathological markers is promising, the mechanism of HD-induced cardiac pathology and the nature of its cell autonomy remain elusive&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Further study of the wide-ranging cardiac function in HD patients is needed. This review highlights published literature on the pathological factors associated with HD-induced cardiac amyloidosis and other cardiovascular diseases, and addresses gaps in this expanding area of study. Through comprehensive experimental and clinical studies, potential drugs can be tested to attenuate and/or ameliorate HD-induced cardiac pathology and mortality.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={5}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Melkani, Girish C.}, year={2016}, month={Sep.}, pages={325‒338} }
