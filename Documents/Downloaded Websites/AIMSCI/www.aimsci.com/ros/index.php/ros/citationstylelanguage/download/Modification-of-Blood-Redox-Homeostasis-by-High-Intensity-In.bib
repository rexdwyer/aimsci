However, because its strenuous nature, sprint interval training may intimidate sedentary individuals. This study investigated the acute and chronic effects of HIIT on blood redox homeostasis, using a training protocol based on a higher number of bouts, of increased duration, performed at 90‒110% of aerobic peak power. Seventeen healthy physically active young men performed a single HIIT session, in cycle ergometer, composed of eight bouts of 1 min at 90% of peak power, intercalated with 75 s-intervals of active recovery at 30 W. The plasma total antioxidant capacity was lower immediately after exercise (p = 0.05), an indicative of increased generation of reactive species in response to HIIT, and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity was increased (p = 0.03). No effect of acute HIIT session on blood thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content was observed. Nine of the initial seventeen volunteers engaged in a four-week progressive HIIT program, 3 days per week, totaling 12 training sessions. Each training session involved 8–12 cycling exercise bouts, at 90‒110 % peak power for 60 s with active recovery intervals of 75 s at 30 W. The plasma total antioxidant capacity as well as erythrocyte catalase activity were increased in response to training (p &amp;lt; 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively), which may have contributed to the reduced TBARS content observed with erythrocytes (p = 0.05). Because HIIT improves blood redox homeostasis, it may have a potential therapeutic effect on the treatment of diseases related to redox imbalance, besides its health promotion effects.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={13}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Costa, Karine Betriz and Magalhães, Silvia Mourão and Aguiar, Paula Fernandes and Ottone, Vinicius de Oliveira and Tossige-Gomes, Rosalina and Magalhães, Flávio de Castro and Amorim, Fabiano Trigueiro and Rocha-Vieira, Etel}, year={2018}, month={Jan.}, pages={56–67} }
