However, the safety of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs is still controversial and the biological mechanism of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs-induced toxicity is not clear yet. We reviewed the research about toxicity of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro or in vivo. TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs could induce significant increase of ROS and excessive free radicals, destroying redox balance. ROS-mediated oxidative stress leads to the occurrence of lipid and protein peroxidation, which in turn would induce autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis of cells. Increased ROS production induced by TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs was generally associated with inflammatory response, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic damage in vitro and in vivo. Although ROS may play an important role in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs-induced biological effects, the specific way it produces and its complex relationship with subsequent biological effects need to be further clarified.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={23}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Zhou, Di and Han, Shuo and Yan, Tenglong and Long, Changmao and Xu, Jiayu and Zheng, Pai and Chen, Zhangjian and Jia, Guang}, year={2019}, month={Sep.}, pages={267â€“275} }
