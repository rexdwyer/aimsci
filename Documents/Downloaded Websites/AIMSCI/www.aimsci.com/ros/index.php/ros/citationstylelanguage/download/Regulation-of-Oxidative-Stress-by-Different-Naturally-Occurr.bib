Different signaling pathways associated with the progression of cancer can modulate the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The level of intracellular ROS is usually high in cancer cells compared to different normal cell types due to abnormal functionality of different genes and perturbed metabolic activity facilitating extensive cellular proliferation. Among a few therapeutic options practiced recently, chemotherapy is the most effective so far. Despite its antitumor efficacy, treatment procedures of chemotherapy have several major side effects and this provokes the scientists for developing novel therapeutic option with minimum toxicity. Different naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds exhibit potential anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic effect in several anticancer studies. The use of different polyphenolic compounds to target the redox status of the cell is a very promising strategy. These pleotropic polyphenolic compounds have been widely documented to modulate different signaling pathways in cancer cells either directly or indirectly. In this comprehensive review, we have summarized the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties of different polyphenolic compounds in various in vitro and in vivo cancer models.}, number={8}, journal={Reactive Oxygen Species}, author={Dutta, Sayanta and Sadhukhan, Pritam and Saha, Sukanya and Sil, Parames C.}, year={2017}, month={Mar.}, pages={81â€’95} }
