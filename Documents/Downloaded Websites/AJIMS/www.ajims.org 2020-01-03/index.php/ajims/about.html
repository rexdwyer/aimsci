	<p><strong>TITLE &amp; ABBREVIATION</strong></p>
<p>Title: American Journal of Innovative Medicine &amp; Standardization<br />Abbreviation: Am J Innov Med Stdzn<br />ISSN: (pending)</p>
<p><strong>FOCUS &amp; SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>AJIMS is a peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the rapid dissemination of new knowledge on both medical innovation (innovative drugs, medical devices, and policies) and standardization (evidence-based consensus and guidelines). AJIMS powers the transformation of innovative medicine &amp; standardization into improved health &amp; wellness for people throughout the globe.</p>
<p>AJIMS publishes the following types of manuscripts:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Editorials<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) News and Perspectives<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Reserarch Highlights<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) Reviews<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(5) Research<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(6) Patient Education</p>
<p><strong>INDEXING &amp; CITATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>SECTION POLICIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editorials</strong></p>
<p>Editorials are articles written by senior editors to either announce a prominent change or address an important issue regarding the contents and formats of the Journal.</p>
<p><strong>News &amp; Perspectives</strong></p>
<p>News and Perspectives are articles primarily written by editorial staff and senior editors to introduce the most current key advances in innovative medicine and standardization and provide perspectives on the future development. AJIMS News focuses on cutting-edge medical discoveries, especially major breakthroughs initially reported in highly influential journals or by prestigious scholarly organizations. AJIMS News also covers new guidelines from well- respected medical professional organizations (e.g., the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Dermatology) and new regulations from the most authoritative governmental agencies [e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)].</p>
<p><strong>Research Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Research Highlights articles are contributed by recognized experts in the field. These articles typically focus on particular research discoveries published, within a year, in one of the most influential bioscience/medical journals and discuss the related research advancement surrounding the particular discovery. The most influential journals include New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association (and its sister journals), Lancet (and its sister journals), Nature (and its sister journals), Science, Cell (and its sister journals), British Medical Journal, Annuals of Internal Medicine, Journal of the American College of Cardiology , and Circulation, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>
<p>Review articles are typically written by recognized experts in the field. The topics include innovative drugs, new medical devices, new clinical guidelines, and emerging regulatory issues. Review Articles must focus on surveying new knowledge published in the most influential journals or released by the most authoritative regulatory agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Original Research</strong></p>
<p>Although outside its focus, AJIMS publishes Original Research articles in the field of innovative medicine. The research studies should focus on innovative translational and clinical research. Research articles are typically contributed by recognized experts in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Education</strong></p>
<p>Patient Education articles are typically written in layman language by medical experts. These articles are intended to educate the patients as well as the general public on lifestyle medicine and health promotion.</p>
<p><strong>PEER-REVIEW PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>As an official journal of the American Association of Innovative Medicine &amp; Standardization (AAIMSD), AJIMS&nbsp; charges no fees for manuscript processing and publishing. The Journal publishes articles of the highest scientific quality and integrity, and emphasizes the quality rather than the quantity of the publications. In this regard, manuscripts submitted to AJIMS undergo a two-phase review process. The manuscript is first evaluated by the Journal’s Editorial Review Committee consisting of three internationally well-recognized experts in the field for its scientific merit and broad impact. This editorial review typically takes less than 3 working days. Manuscripts judged to be of significant scientific merit and broad impact then undergo the second-phase peer review by at least two outside experts in the field. Manuscripts judged to be of limited scientific merit and little broad impact by the Editorial Review Committee are declined without further undergoing the second-phase peer review.</p>
<p>The eventual acceptance of a manuscript for publication in AJIMS will be primarily based on assessing the peer reviewers’ comments in four areas including (1) the originality, (2) the quality, (3) the potential impact, and (4) the readability of the work in conjunction with the recommendations by the Journal’s Editorial Review Committee.</p>
<p>The typical turn-around time for peer review is about 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHING FREQUENCY</strong></p>
<p>AJIMS currently publishes two issues annually.</p>
<p><strong>ARCHIVING</strong></p>
<p>AJIMS utilizes the LOCKSS system to create a distributed archiving system among participating libraries and permits those libraries to create permanent archives of the journal for purposes of preservation and restoration. <a href="http://www.lockss.org/">More...</a></p>
<p><strong>NO PUBLICATION FEES</strong></p>
<p>There are no fees associated with processing and publishing articles in AJIMS. Selection of a manuscript for publication in AJIMS is solely based on the scientific merit and impact of the work as judged primarily by assessing the peer reviewers' comments in combination with the recommendations by the Journal's Editorial Review Committee.</p>
<p>The AJIMS Editorial Office strongly discourages the withdrawal of an accepted manuscript by the author(s) at the late stage of copyediting/layout editing unless for a reason related to research ethics. A fee may need to be paid by the author(s) to defray the costs incurred for copy-editing/layout-editing of the accepted manuscript if the author(s) decides to withdraw the accepted manuscript at this late stage of publication in ROS.</p>
<p><strong>SERVING ON THE BOARD&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The AJIMS Editorial Office greatly appreciates the support and contributions from the members of the advisory and editorial board. Serving on the board of AJIMS does not bear any obligations though the board member is encouraged to submit and/or recommend manuscripts of sufficient quality to the Journal. Appointment for serving on the board of AJIMS is typically on a 3-year term. The board member may decide to discontinue the appointment at any time by sending an email notice to the AJIMS Editorial Office (editorial@ajims.org) without providing any reasons. Likewise, the Journal reserves the right to terminate the board member status at any time during the 3-year appointment term without any stated reasons.</p>
<p><strong>ETHICS IN PUBLISHING</strong></p>
<p>As stated elsewhere in the Journal, AJIMS strives to publish articles of the highest scientific quality and integrity. The Journal strictly adheres to the fundamental principles of ethics in publishing. In this context, the Journal follows the pertinent guidelines and recommendations by respected organizations, including the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (IIMJE)</a> (http://www.icmje.org), the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>, (http://publicationethics.org) and the <a href="https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/">Council of Science Editors (CSE)</a> (https://www.councilscienceeditors.org). The Journal asks that the editors, reviewers, and authors please follow appropriate guidelines and recommendations on good publication practice when handle or prepare manuscripts for the Journal.</p>
