		<p>AJIMS uses a fully web-based manuscript submission and tracking system for all types of manuscripts. In addition to its online submission, AJIMS also accepts manuscript submission via email attachments. All the requirements/permissions for online submission also apply to email submission. Submitting your manuscript via email attachment to AJIMS is taken to mean that you fully agree to the requirements/permissions set forth in the online submission process. For email submission, please send your manuscript via email attachment(s) to: editorial@ajims.org</p>

<p><em>Manuscript Format</em></p>
<p>Editorial articles should be no more than 1000 words in length excluding the references. The manuscript should include a title, the name and affiliation of the author (typically the senior editor of the Journal), and the main text. The main text may be divided into several sections and when applicable, a list of references (no more than 20) should be provided at the end of the manuscript.
